3i.
If I collaborate with other students I need to include their names in my references document and if not,
I need to state that I didn't work with anyone.  Also, I can't do homework with people outside of my group.
Which I assume means people not in the class.

3ii.
I can consult any external resources except for gernerative AI tools, like ChatGPT.
Those external resources I use must also be included in the references document.

3iii.
Late assignments will be accepted however, for each day an assignment is late, a 10% penalty will be applied.

3iv.
The penalty for missing classes is simply finding out yourself what was missed and
making it up if the professor permits.  If the student has missed a significant portion of coursework through
absence, the penalty would possibly be withdrawl or late withdrawl.
